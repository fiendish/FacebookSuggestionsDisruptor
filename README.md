# FacebookSuggestionsDisruptor
Functions for making Facebook slightly less obnoxious to look at.

This does not hide elements from the DOM.
It tries to interact with remove buttons to indicate offense or dislike for all suggestions.
This is definitely the long way around, but the goal here is signaling to the system instead 
of just hiding things with the hope that it sends you fewer suggestions in the future.
